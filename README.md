# X-Ray Attenuation Through the Atmosphere
## Introduction:
Nuclear Explosions release a wide spectrum of EM radiation with a considerable amount in the x-ray region.  As this radiation propagates through the atmosphere, the rays are attenuated at different rates based on their energy.  Modeling how a spectrum will evolve as it propagates can be useful to better understand the signatures of a nuclear weapon and aid in their detection.
## Running the Code:
Code can be compiled using: $gcc attenuation.c -o attenuation -lm

Code can be executed using: $./attenuation

Spectrum evolution can be plotted using: $gnuplot att.p
